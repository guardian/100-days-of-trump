Trump, who has sold himself as the ultimate deal maker, could not strike the deal and reports suggested that he had little grasp of the details.\n\nAnd soon after taking office, Trump signed an [executive order](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/16/trump-new-travel-ban-blocked-explainer-what-next) to ban visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries; the result was an outcry over a betrayal of America's values, pandemonium at airports and defeat in the courts. A revised ban met the same fate. It was an early victory for Americaâ€™s system of checks and balances that prompted Trump to vent his frustration. "},{"section":"Tone","graphic":"data","chartTitle":"Number of tweets","copy":"It became clear very quickly that President Trump would be the same as candidate Trump. In his inaugural address, he spoke of [â€œAmerican carnageâ€](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/20/donald-trump-inauguration-speech-analysis) and set out a flinty nationalist agenda. \n\nOne day later, Trumpâ€™s press secretary Sean Spicer angrily berated the media over its reporting on the size of his [inaugural crowd](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/22/trump-inauguration-crowd-sean-spicers-claims-versus-the-evidence), falsely claiming that Trumpâ€™s had been bigger than Obamaâ€™s, setting the tone for 100 days of belligerence and combative relations with the press.\n\nThe president is still holding campaign rallies and still reflecting on the election as if happiest when heâ€™s fighting. Sexism and racism have been less explicit than during the election campaign but there have been peculiar incidents such as a failure to shake German chancellor [Angela Merkelâ€™s hand](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/mar/17/donald-trump-angela-merkel-no-handshake-video) and the blunt language of â€œradical Islamic terrorismâ€ .\n\nSince becoming president, Trump has put out nearly a thousand tweets. Some are impulsively fired off at all hours of the night - often in response to items broadcast on Fox News. A tone more different from Obama is harder to imagine."},{"section":"Legislative agenda","graphic":"data","chartTitle":"Number of executive orders","copy":"At his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump promised a â€œnew chapter in American greatnessâ€ . He spoke of healthcare reform, a tax overhaul, a trillion dollar infrastructure package and the breath of life for dying industries to create millions of new jobs. There was also his plan for a wall on the Mexican border, of which there is no sign of construction yet.\n\nBut while Trump has signed more executive orders than any of his 12 predecessors, he has no major legislation to his name and has failed to break the Washington gridlock.\n\nAfter spending seven years fighting Obamacare, the party could not get its act together to find a replacement that they all agreed on. Similar divisions could plague sweeping [tax reform](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/26/trump-tax-cuts-proposal-deductions-brackets) announced on Wednesday while the infrastructure package is likely to need support from Democrats, something they have no incentive under pressure from grassroots activists.\n\nHis failure to earn trust, for example because of his tweets accusing [Obama of wiretapping](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/15/wiretap-trump-house-intelligence-committee), have â€œaffected the ability of the president to get legislation achievements, which is crucial,â€ says Leon Panetta, former defence secretary and CIA director. â€œYou cannot be a president and govern by executive orders.

But he is the first president in US history to have no public sector experience and, some would say, it shows in instances small and big.\n\nThere have been press releases with spelling mistakes and press briefings by Spicer littered with mispronunciations and worse; he was forced to apologise for claiming that [Adolf Hitler](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/11/sean-spicer-hitler-chemical-weapons-holocaust-assad) did not use chemical weapons against his own people. \n\nThe travel ban was widely criticised as rushed with a chronic lack of basic consultation and fact checking, for example on the status of green card holders from the affected countries. It ran into the buzzsaw of the courts. The health care bill fared no better with the Congressional Budget Office warning that it would result in [24 million](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/13/budget-office-republican-healthcare-coverage-deficit-costs) more uninsured Americans by 2026. â€œNobody knew healthcare could be so complicated,â€ Trump confessed.\n\nTrump has spent around three quarters of his presidency at the White House. On numerous weekends he has gone to Mar-a-Lago, his â€œwinter White Houseâ€ in Palm Beach, Florida. He is regularly on the golf course despite criticising Obama for playing.\n\nBenjamin Wittes, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told an audience at the think tank this week: â€œIn the bilateral battle between malevolence and incompetence, incompetence is certainly winning.â€ "},{"section":"Global player","graphic":"data","chartTitle":"World leaders Trump has met","copy":"The election of Trump last November was a shot heard around the world. Rarely had there been such uncertainty in foreign capitals yet the worst prophecies of doom have not come to pass. \n\nSo far it seems the Trump doctrine is that there is no doctrine, but rather a pragmatic response to circumstances on a case by case basis. The â€œAmerica firstâ€  isolationism that fired up his supporters was jettisoned when the president saw primetime images of children and â€œbeautiful babiesâ€ gassed in Syria. [Trump ordered](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons) a strike by 59 Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian airfield in response.\n\nThe intervention was praised by Republican hawks as decisive leadership but he president spoiled the effect somewhat in a TV interview in which he [recalled](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/12/trump-xi-jinping-chocolate-cake-syria-strikes) ordering the attack over â€œthe most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you have ever seenâ€ .\n\nAggressive postures have also been taken towards North Korea and Iran. Authoritarian figures in Egypt and Turkey have been embraced. There have also been head-snapping reversals, with Russia falling out of favour and China falling into favour and, as for Nato: â€œI said it was obsolete. Itâ€™s no longer obsolete.â€ \n\nPanetta says: â€œI think the world has drawn some degree of comfort by virtue of the national security team but there are still mixed messages going out as to whether there is any underlying strategy to the steps heâ€™s taking on Syria and North Korea.â€ "},{"section":"The Russia question","graphic":"timeline","chartTitle":"Trouble with Russia","copy":"US intelligence agencies [concluded](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report) that Moscow-backed hackers meddled in the presidential election to tip the scales against Hillary Clinton and in favour of Trump. But the burning question is whether Trumpâ€™s campaign actively colluded with a foreign adversary - a potential scandal bigger than Watergate.\n\nThere has been a drip-drip of revelations and investigations launched by the House, Senate and FBI. It is not yet known if their witnesses will include Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence operative who compiled a [dossier](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/11/trump-russia-dossier-explainer-details) containing salacious allegations linking Trump to Moscow.\n\n[Mike Flynn](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/13/michael-flynn-resigns-quits-trump-national-security-adviser-russia) became the first major casualty of the administration when he was forced to resign for misleading Vice-President Mike Pence over his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Attorney general Jeff Sessions also faced calls to quit and conceded: â€œI should have slowed down and said, â€˜But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times.â€™â€ \n\nAccording to recent reports, federal investigators have gathered intelligence that suggests Russian operatives may have used Carter Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker whom Trump referred to as a foreign policy adviser during the presidential race, to gain access to the candidate. Page, who has â€œpro-Kremlinâ€  views, has denied sharing any information of consequence."},{"section":"Team Trump","graphic":"timeline","chartTitle":"The fortunes of Trump's team","copy":"The internecine warfare, intrguing plot twists and rise and fall of various [protagonists](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/04/trump-inner-circle-white-house-court) has made Game of Thrones look positively modest. For a while it seemed that chief strategist Steve Bannon, anti-globalist advocate for dismantling the administrative state, was all powerful, but then the former head of Breitbart News apparently flew too close to the sun.Trump is said to have been irritated by what he saw as Bannonâ€™s self-aggrandising appearance on a Time magazine cover with the label, â€œThe Great Manipulatorâ€ ,\n\nInstead it is now a New York faction that holds sway: Ivanka has a formal position and her husband Jared Kushner has an outsized portfolio, while Goldman Sachs veterans Gary Cohn, chief economic adviser, and Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary, increasingly have the presidentâ€™s ear. The inner circle also includes Vice-President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff Reince Preibus, policy adviser [Stephen Miller](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/15/stephen-miller-new-trump-travel-ban) and senior adviser [Kellyanne Conway](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/10/kellyanne-conway-white-house-gaffes-three-strikes-but-not-yet-out), whose gaffes have included a reference to â€œalternative factsâ€ .\n\nSecretary of state Rex Tillerson made a slow start, but sprang into life at the time of the Syria strike with harsh words for Russia. Trumpâ€™s national security team has drawn particular praise: after Flynnâ€™s departure, he chose the widely respected H R McMaster as national security adviser, a move that led to Bannonâ€™s departure from the national security council. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is also a relatively conventional choice.\n\nBut other appointments have set alarm bells ringing. Sessions is an anti-immigration hardliner who has faced allegations of racism. [Scott Pruitt](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/17/scott-pruitt-confirmed-epa-emails-senate), head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is a climate change sceptic who previously sued the agency 14 times.
