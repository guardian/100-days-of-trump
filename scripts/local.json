{"sheets":{"Body":[{"section":"intro","graphic":"","chartTitle":"","copy":"Words such as \"unprecedented\" and \"uncharted territory\" have been drained of meaning. But on the white knuckle ride of Donald Trump's presidency, one thing has not changed. He took office with the lowest approval rating of any incoming president; he now has the lowest approval rating of any president at the 100-day mark, although polls suggest his base remains loyal."},{"section":"Greatest achievements","graphic":"timeline","chartTitle":"Trump's greatest achievements","copy":"The most notable and durable achievement is Trumpâ€™s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the supreme court despite concerted opposition from Democrats. His selection was welcomed by conservatives as a successor to Antonin Scalia, who died 14 months ago. The president has also signed a record 13 resolutions to roll back regulations, billed by the White House as \"getting government out of the way\" to create jobs, and moved swiftly to punish Syria for using chemical weapons.\n\nLanhee Chen, a Republican adviser and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford, California, says: â€œThe high points are the Neil Gorsuch nomination and confirmation. Heâ€™s also accomplished a bit on regulatory reform and the decisive action in Syria was a high because it demonstrated how different his approach to foreign policy issues is from Barack Obama.â€"},{"section":"Worst failures","graphic":"timeline","chartTitle":"Trump's worst failures","copy":"\nBut to many observers, the list of failures is far longer. Even Chen admits that Trumpâ€™s rushed attempt to repeal and replace Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare legislation, which crashed in the House of Representatives, was â€œa debacleâ€.\n\nAnd soon after taking office, Trump signed an executive order to ban visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries; the result was an outcry, pandemonium at airports and defeat in the courts. A revised ban met the same fate. It was an early victory for Americaâ€™s system of checks and balances.\n\nOverall, however, Trumpâ€™s greatest achievement may be in the opposition movement he has created. Starting with womenâ€™s marches and Washington and other cities in the US and around the world, people have been energised, galvanised and politicised as never before in their lifetimes. Trump is the unwitting father of the resistance."},{"section":"Tone","graphic":"data","chartTitle":"Number of tweets","copy":"It became clear very quickly that President Trump would be the same as candidate Trump. The long hoped for pivot never came. In his inaugural address, he spoke of â€œAmerican carnageâ€ and set out a flinty nationalist agenda. Former president George W Bush reportedly said later: â€œThat was some weird shit.â€\n\nA day later, Trumpâ€™s press secretary Sean Spicer angrily berated the media over its reporting on the size of his inaugural crowd, falsely claiming that Trumpâ€™s had been bigger than Obamaâ€™s. It set the tone for 100 days of belligerance and combative relations with the press, which in February Trump branded â€œthe enemy of the peopleâ€.\n\nThe president has also made baseless claims that millions of people voted illegally in the election and Obama wiretapped his election campaign headquarters. He stood before a memorial wall at the CIA to boast about his inaugural crowd and attack the media. Last week he compared his TV ratings to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.\n\nNeil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive group Democracy for America, says: â€œIf thereâ€™s anything weâ€™ve learned from the last hundred days itâ€™s that there is no Donald Trump 2.0. The same vile bigot who ran a disgusting campaign for president is now sitting in the chair in the Oval Office. President Trump has acted exactly the way you might have expected candidate Trump to act. He will not change; what can change is the way Americans meant to him.â€\n\nThe president is still holding campaign rallies and still harps on about the election as if happiest when heâ€™s fighting. Sexism and racism have been less explicit than during the election campaign but there have been peculiar incidents such as a failure to shake German chancellor Angela Merkelâ€™s hand and the blunt language of â€œradical Islamic terrorismâ€.\n\nSince becoming president, Trump has put out nearly a thousand tweets. Some are impulsively fired off at all hours of the night - often in response to items broadcast on Fox News. A tone more different from Obama is harder to imagine."},{"section":"Legislative agenda","graphic":"data","chartTitle":"Number of executive orders","copy":"At his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump promised a â€œnew chapter in American greatnessâ€. He spoke of healthcare reform, a tax overhaul, a trillion dollar infrastructure package and the breath of life for dying industries to create millions of new jobs. And, of course, there was his plan for a border wall on the Mexican border, of which there is no sign of construction yet.\n\nBut while Trump has signed more executive orders than any of his 12 predecessors at this stage, he has no major legislation to his name and, as might be expected for a political novice who ran against the Washington establishment, relations with Congress are strained with Republicans dreading every tweet.\n\nAfter spending seven years fighting Obamacare tooth and nail, the party could not get its act together to find a replacement that they all agreed on. Trump, who has sold himself as the ultimate deal maker, could not strike the deal and reports suggested that he had little grasp of the details.\n\nSimilar divisions could plague sweeping tax reform announced on Wednesday while the infrastructure package is likely to need support from Democrats, something they have no incentive under pressure from grassroots activists. Trump, a pragmatist with little ideology, has failed to break the hyperpartisan Washington gridlock that stifled Obama.\n\nHis failure to earn trust, for example because of his tweets accusing Obama of wiretapping, have â€œaffected the ability of the president to get legislation achievements, which is crucial,â€ says Leon Panetta, former defence secretary and CIA director. â€œYou cannot be a president and govern by executive orders. The fact heâ€™s been issuing them all has been more politicking than effective policy and some has run into checks and balances.â€"},{"section":"Competence","graphic":"data","chartTitle":"Time spent in Washington","copy":"Trump claimed at a freewheeling press conference that his administration is â€˜running like a fine-tuned machineâ€. But he is the first president in US history to have no public sector experience and, some would say, it shows in instances small and big.\n\nThere have been press releases with spelling mistakes and press briefings by Spicer littered with mispronunciations and worse; he was forced to apologise for claiming that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his own people. Chaos and confusion within the White House has become an open secret.\n\nThe travel ban was widely criticised as rushed with a chronic lack of basic consultation and fact checking, for example on the status of green card holders from the affected countries. It ran into the buzzsaw of the courts. The health care bill fared no better with the Congressional Budget Office warning that it would result in 24 million more uninsured Americans by 2026. â€œNobody knew healthcare could be so complicated,â€ Trump confessed. As steep learning curves go, it is close to vertical.\n\nBill Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, says: â€œThe first executive order blew up in the White Houseâ€™s face and there has been a very slow start on the personnel front, from cabinet level to below where nobodyâ€™s been nominated. The White House is anything but a well oiled machine. There seem to be factions and divisions.â€\n\nTrump has spent around three quarters of his presidency at the White House. On numerous weekends he has gone to Mar-a-Lago, his â€œwinter White Houseâ€ in Palm Beach, Florida. He is regularly on the golf course despite criticising Obama for playing.\n\nBenjamin Wittes, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told an audience at the think tank this week: â€œIn the bilateral battle between malevolence and incompetence, incompetence is certainly winning... The administration has actually managed to get done relatively little in the malevolence department largely because it canâ€™t get anything done.â€"},{"section":"Facing the world","graphic":"data","chartTitle":"Number of bombs dropped","copy":"The election of Trump last November was a shot heard around the world. Rarely had there been such uncertainty in foreign capitals. The German magazine Der Spiegel depicted Trumpâ€™s head as a giant asteroid hurtling towards earth.\n\nThe worst prophecies of doom have not come to pass, at least not yet. Sroka observes: â€œItâ€™s better than nuclear holocaust but itâ€™s still pretty disastrous. The trouble with grading Trumpâ€™s first hundred days is itâ€™s so rife with failure and lies you canâ€™t measure it.â€\n\nSo far it seems the Trump doctrine is that there is no doctrine, but rather a pragmatic response to circumstances on a case by case basis. The â€œAmerica firstâ€ isolationism that fired up his supporters on the alt-right was jettisoned when the president saw primetime images of children and â€œbeautiful babiesâ€ gassed in Syria. Trump ordered a strike by 59 Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian airfield in response.\n\nThe intervention was praised by Republican hawks as decisive leadership but he president spoiled the effect somewhat in a TV interview in which he recalled ordering the attack over â€œthe most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you have ever seenâ€.\n\nSroka adds: â€œIf there was anything as a progressive I agreed on with Trump it was not getting involved in a bloody civil war in Syria and he even managed to screw that up.â€\n\nAggressive postures have also been taken towards North Korea and Iran. Authoritarian figures in Egypt and Turkey have been embraced, There have also been head-snapping reversals, with Russia falling out of favour and China falling into favour and, as for Nato: â€œI said it was obsolete. Itâ€™s no longer obsolete.â€\n\nIn one clear signal of intent, he unveiled a budget proposal that would boost US military hardware and cut the state department and foreign aid by nearly a third. Panetta says: â€œI think the world has drawn some degree of comfort by virtue of the national security team but there are still mixed messages going out as to whether there is any underlying strategy to the steps heâ€™s taking on Syria and North Korea.â€"},{"section":"Conflicts of interest","graphic":"graphics","chartTitle":"Cost of Trump's other interested to the taxpayer","copy":"For a president to own an international business empire on such a scale is unprecedented. At a press conference on 11 January, Trump said he would remove himself from the day-to-day operation of his eponymous organisation and put his holdings in a revocable trust managed by his two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr.\n\nBut while this removes him from day-to-day decision making, [ProPublica reported](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-pull-money-his-businesses-whenever-he-wants-without-telling-us) that Trump could draw money from the trust at any time without external disclosure. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a lawsuit arguing that Trumpâ€™s business holdings violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which makes it illegal for government officials to â€œaccept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.â€\n\nThe Trump International Hotel, a few blocks from the White House, is popular with diplomats, raising the prospect that foreign governments could see booking expensive rooms there as a way to curry favour with the president.\n\nAnd on the day that Ivanka Trump sat next to Chinese president at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the Chinese government approved three new trademarks for her company to sell items in China. White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway was reprimanded after urging TV viewers to buy Ivankaâ€™s products.\n\nThe White House insists that Trump has made â€œsacrificesâ€ and is not taking a salary, donating the first chunk to national parks. But the president continues to break with four decades of tradition by refusing to release his tax returns, an intransigence that threatens to derail his tax reform agenda."},{"section":"The Russia question","graphic":"timeline","chartTitle":"Something","copy":"All this... and Russia too. US intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow-backed hackers meddled in the presidential election to tip the scales against Hillary Clinton and in favour of Trump. The Republican nominee gleefully rode the wave, frequently quoting from hacked emails during his campaign. But the burning question is whether this was a mere coincidence of interests or whether Trumpâ€™s campaign actively colluded with a foreign adversary - a potential scandal bigger than Watergate.\n\nThere has been a drip-drip of revelations over the past hundred days and investigations launched by the House, Senate and FBI. It is not yet known if their witnesses will include Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence operative who compiled a dossier containing salacious allegations linking Trump to Moscow.\n\nMike Flynn became the first major casualty of the administration when he was forced to resign for misleading Vice-President Mike Pence over his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Attorney general Jeff Sessions also faced calls to quit and conceded: â€œI should have slowed down and said, â€˜But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times.â€™â€\n\nAccording to recent reports, federal investigators have gathered intelligence that suggests Russian operatives may have used Carter Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker whom Trump referred to as a foreign policy adviser during the presidential race, to gain access to the candidate. Page, who has â€œpro-Kremlinâ€ views, has denied sharing any information of consequence.\n\nThe White House accused reporters of being fixated on the Russia allegations without evidence. Trumpâ€™s son Eric claimed that the missile strike on Syria, which is backed by Vladimir Putin, proves that there was no conspiracy. The House intelligence committee inquiry was tarnished by allegations that chairman Devin Nunes made unauthorised disclosures of classified information, prompting him to recuse himself."},{"section":"Team Trump","graphic":"timeline","chartTitle":"The fortunes of Trump's team","copy":"The internecine warfare, intrguing plot twists and rise and fall of various protagonists has made Game of Thrones look positively modest. For a while it seemed that chief strategist Steve Bannon, anti-globalist advocate for dismantling the administrative state, was all powerful, but then the former head of Breitbart News apparently flew too close to the sun.Trump is said to have been irritated by what he saw as Bannonâ€™s self-aggrandising appearance on a Time magazine cover with the label, â€œThe Great Manipulatorâ€,\n\nInstead it is now a New York faction that is believed to hold sway: Ivanka has a formal position and her husband Jared Kushner has an outsized portfolio, while Goldman Sachs veterans Gary Cohn, chief economic adviser, and Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary, increasingly have the presidentâ€™s ear. The inner circle also includes Vice-President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff Reince Preibus, policy adviser Stephen Miller and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, whose gaffes have included a reference to â€œalternative factsâ€.\n\nPanetta says: â€œThere is sense the White House is not functioning as it should do because thereâ€™s the Bannon faction and the Kushner faction and youâ€™re not sure whoâ€™s in charge in terms of forming policy for the president.â€\n\nSecretary of state Rex Tillerson made a slow start and mostly shunned the press, but sprang into life at the time of the Syria strike with harsh words for Russia. Trumpâ€™s national security team has drawn particular praise: after Flynnâ€™s departure, he chose the widely respected H R McMaster as national security adviser, a move that led to Bannonâ€™s departure from the national security council. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is also a relatively conventional choice.\n\nBut other appointments have set alarm bells ringing. Sessions is an anti-immigration hardliner who has faced allegations of racism. Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is a climate change sceptic who previously sued the agency 14 times. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Health Secretary Tom Price champion privatisation while Ben Carson has made little impact as housing secretary. In stark contrast to the Obama years, the cabinet looks like a throwback to the 20th century in terms of diversity."},{"section":"outro","graphic":"","chartTitle":"","copy":"The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.
